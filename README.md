# Ravennodes

This project is based on [Bitnodes](https://github.com/ayeowch/bitnodes).

Ravennodes is currently being developed to estimate the size of the Ravencoin network by finding all the reachable nodes in the network. The current methodology involves sending `getaddr` messages recursively to find all the reachable nodes in the network, starting from a set of seed nodes.

## Dependencies:
- Python 2.7
- [Redis](https://redislabs.com/)

## Steps on setting up a machine to run Ravennodes 
TBA

## Further development

First tests on Feb 3rd, 2019, indicate that the Ravennodes is working on Ubuntu 18.04.
